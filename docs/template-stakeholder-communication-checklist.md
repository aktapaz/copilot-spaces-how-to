## Communication Best Practices

### Effective Updates
- **Be concise**: Stakeholders are busy—lead with key information
- **Be honest**: Share challenges alongside successes
- **Be proactive**: Don't wait for stakeholders to ask for updates
- **Be visual**: Use charts, dashboards, or screenshots when helpful
- **Be consistent**: Maintain regular communication cadence

### Red Flags to Communicate Immediately
- Critical bugs or security issues
- Major timeline slippages (>20% delay)
- Scope creep that affects other teams
- Resource constraints threatening delivery
- Dependencies that are blocked or at risk
- Customer escalations or negative feedback

## Example Stakeholder Matrix

| Stakeholder Group | Primary Contact | Communication Frequency | Preferred Channel | Key Information Needs |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Executive Sponsor | Jane Doe | Bi-weekly | Email summary | ROI, timeline, major risks |
| Product Team | John Smith | Weekly | Slack + standup | Feature progress, dependencies |
| Engineering | Dev Lead | Daily | Standup + GitHub | Technical blockers, PRs |
| Sales | Sales VP | Monthly | Email | Launch dates, customer impact |
| Support | Support Manager | Pre-release + post-release | Email + training session | New features, known issues |
