# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub. This collection provides a structured, iterative approach to running projects that deliver customer value while maintaining team excellence.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme's project management approach emphasizes:

- **Customer value focus**: Prioritize features and decisions that directly benefit customers and meet their needs
- **Data-informed decisions**: Use metrics and evidence to guide planning, execution, and retrospectives
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has defined roles with explicit responsibilities (PM, Product Lead, Team Members)
- **Risk transparency**: Identify, track, and communicate risks early and often throughout the project lifecycle
- **Team learning**: Capture insights through retrospectives and continuously improve processes

This framework supports cross-functional collaboration across initiation, planning, execution, release, and continuous improvement phases.
