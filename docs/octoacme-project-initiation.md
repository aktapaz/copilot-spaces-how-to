# OctoAcme — Project Initiation Guide

## Purpose
Define the initial steps to validate and authorize work, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan.

## When to use
Whenever a new project idea or feature proposal is ready to be explored.

## Goals
- Confirm business need and measurable outcome
- Identify stakeholders & champions
- Define success criteria and initial timeline
- Decide go/no-go for planning

## Minimum Deliverables
- Project One-pager (Problem, Goal, Success Metrics)
- Stakeholder list & communication plan
- High-level timeline and key milestones
- Initial risk list
- Resource needs (team roles, rough effort estimate)

## Project One-pager Template
- **Project name**: [Clear, memorable name]
- **Problem statement**: [What problem are we solving? Who is affected?]
- **Objective / Goal (SMART)**: [Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound goal]
- **Success metrics**: [How will we measure success? What are the KPIs?]
- **Primary stakeholders**: [Who needs to be involved? Who approves decisions?]
- **Suggested timeline / milestones**: [High-level phases with target dates]
- **Quick risks & dependencies**: [Top 3-5 risks; key dependencies on other teams]
- **Proposed team / roles**: [Who will work on this? What expertise is needed?]

### Example: Project One-pager for "Customer Dashboard v2"

- **Project name**: Customer Dashboard v2
- **Problem statement**: Current customer dashboard has 45% bounce rate and doesn't show real-time data, leading to support tickets and customer frustration. 2,000+ customers affected daily.
- **Objective / Goal**: Launch a redesigned dashboard with real-time updates and improved UX, reducing bounce rate to <25% within 30 days of launch.
- **Success metrics**: 
  - Bounce rate < 25%
  - Time-to-insight < 30 seconds (from login to first data view)
  - Support tickets related to dashboard decreased by 40%
  - Customer satisfaction (CSAT) score > 4.2/5
- **Primary stakeholders**: Product Lead (Jane Doe), Support Team (John Smith), Customer Success VP (Mary Johnson)
- **Suggested timeline / milestones**:
  - Week 1-2: Discovery & design
  - Week 3-6: Development & testing
  - Week 7: Staging validation & beta testing
  - Week 8: Production rollout
- **Quick risks & dependencies**:
  - R-001: Real-time data pipeline may not scale (Medium priority)
  - R-002: Design reviews could delay timeline (Low priority)
  - Dependency on Data Platform team for API updates
- **Proposed team / roles**:
  - PM: Alex Chen
  - Product Designer: Sarah Lee
  - Frontend Engineers: 2 (React expertise)
  - Backend Engineer: 1 (API optimization)
  - QA: Pat Kumar
